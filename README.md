## 📖 Overview

This project explores a bold new framework where **mass**, **gravity**, and **force** are not treated as fundamental, but instead as **emergent phenomena** arising from the **confinement of oscillatory energy**.

By modeling how standing waveforms behave under **geometric and energetic boundaries**, we demonstrate that:
- Mass-like **inertia**
- Apparent **spacetime curvature**
- Force-like **interactions**

can be derived from **internal wave feedback** and **nonlinear field dynamics**.

## 🧠 Core Contributions

- 🔬 A **modified Lagrangian** formulation with **curvature-driven** and **entropy-regulating** terms
- ⚙️ Simulations showing the formation of **localized energy concentrations** and **effective force fields**
- 🧪 Proposed **experimental validation** using:
  - Optical cavities
  - Plasmonic lattices
  - Ultracold atom traps

## 🌀 Foundational Insight

> Geometry is not a background stage — it's a dynamic outcome of vibrational coherence.

This theory reframes physical reality as a **layered computation of confined wave interference**, described as:

Mass ← emerges from Energy
Energy ← emerges from Resonance
Resonance ← emerges from Boundary
Boundary ← emerges from Information

## 🔑 Conceptual Summary

- **Nonlinear distortion of standing waves** gives rise to geometry and mass
- **Numerical simulations** confirm force gradients from wave confinement
- **Testable predictions** make this model viable for near-future validation
