## Overview  
This project presents a unified physical framework in which mass, force, and spacetime curvature are not fundamental, but instead emerge from confined oscillatory wave dynamics. Starting from a geometry-free foundation, the model derives inertial mass and field interactions from nonlinear feedback and topological resonance.

By simulating how standing waves evolve under curvature confinement and entropy-regulated dynamics, we demonstrate that:

- Mass-like inertia arises from spatial coherence  
- Spacetime curvature emerges as a wavefield metric  
- Forces appear as gradients in constrained wave feedback

## Core Contributions  
- A modified covariant Lagrangian with curvature and entropy-regulating terms  
- High-precision simulations demonstrating localized, stable energy structures and emergent force gradients  
- Ensemble-averaged derivations of fundamental structural constants (ξ, σ, γ, β, θ)  
- Proposed experimental validation via:
  - Optical cavities  
  - Ultracold atom lattices  
  - Casimir force deviations  
  - Gravitational wave tail distortions

## Foundational Insight  
**"Geometry is not a backdrop — it is the outcome of sustained resonance."**

This theory reframes physical law as a computation of confined wave interference:

Mass ← Emerges from Energy
Energy ← Emerges from Resonance
Resonance ← Emerges from Boundary
Boundary ← Emerges from Information

## Summary of Evidence  
- Covariant field equations consistent with U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) gauge structures  
- Numerical simulations confirm coherence-induced confinement and gradient-driven forces  
- Entropy-curvature coupling regulates localization and predicts structure lifetime  
- Specific, testable predictions proposed for lab and astrophysical systems
